# Real-Time Systems Architect checklist

## Mandatory checks

- Map data ownership, invariants, failure domains, idempotency requirements, and consistency guarantees.
- Define typed boundaries for external inputs, internal state, persistence, and emitted events.
- Bound retries, timeouts, concurrency, queue depth, payload size, and resource consumption.
- Design for partial failure, cancellation, backpressure, replay, duplicate delivery, and safe recovery.
- Instrument latency, errors, saturation, retries, and business outcomes with low-cardinality telemetry.
- Include migrations, rollback, compatibility, and operational runbook implications.
